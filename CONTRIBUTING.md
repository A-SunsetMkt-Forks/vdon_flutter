Contribution Policy

You are invited to digitally sign the CLA with the provided CLA Assissant service. You may also print, sign, scan, and then email the CLA to steve@seguin.email.

It is not required that you sign the CLA for every contribution. Once you execute a CLA, it is valid until the CLA agreement is meaningfully changed and requires updating.

Important notice: if you are contributing on behalf of your company, an officer of your company (usually a VP or higher title) must sign the CLA on behalf of the company, indicating his or her title. The company can choose to list the specific individuals authorized to make contributions on the "Full Name" line, or may cover all employees with a blanket CLA by not limiting contributors to an authorized list. If necessary, the company may provide a list of authorized contributors in an attachment. The executive signing the CLA must be the first name on such an attached list, and this executive must sign the attachment as well. It may well be the case that your company already has signed a company-wide CLA with Stephen Seguin. Please check this first.

You can stop your participation in a project at any time, but you cannot rescind your assignments or grants with respect to prior contributions.
